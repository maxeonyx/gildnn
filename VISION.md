# Overall Vision

This project explores a neural network architecture that processes temporal information through overlapping waves of activity across its depth. The aim is to investigate how staggered propagation, predictive training strategies, and integrated visualization can unlock new capabilities. Core ideas include:

- Allow asynchronous progression of time steps through deep layers so multiple temporal slices are in-flight simultaneously.
- Merge neural network training with real-time graphics pipelines to visualize internal dynamics as they unfold.
- Teach the model to anticipate its own optimization trajectory by forecasting upcoming loss signals.
- Expand output heads to cover variable-length byte sequences, enabling dynamic chunking during inference.
- Give the system the ability to emit results from multiple depths by learning per-layer loss forecasts and adaptive halting.

Together these threads form a research program into highly parallel, introspective recurrent systems that offer live insight into their computation.
