# Self-Predicted Loss Signals

## Objective
Enable the model to forecast the magnitude of its forthcoming loss, providing a meta-objective that guides optimization decisions.

## Key Ideas
- Attach auxiliary heads that regress future loss values over multiple horizons.
- Incorporate the predicted loss into adaptive learning rate or gradient clipping schemes.
- Compare predicted and realized losses to produce calibration metrics for meta-learning.

## Open Questions
- Which training targets best capture upcoming loss dynamics (next step, rolling average, percentile)?
- How should discrepancies between predicted and actual loss influence gradient updates?
- Can loss forecasts inform curriculum learning or dynamic batch sizing policies?
