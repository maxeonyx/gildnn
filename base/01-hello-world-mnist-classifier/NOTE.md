# Hello World MNIST Classifier

Objective:
- Stand up the core training harness with the smallest possible supervised task.

Key Requirements:
- Download MNIST, normalize inputs, and create batched dataloaders.
- Implement a minimal CNN or MLP classifier using the shared model interface.
- Provide configuration files for optimizer, scheduler, and training length.
- Emit evaluation metrics (accuracy, loss) and checkpoint artifacts.

Scaffolding Expectations:
- Define the base project layout (data module, model module, trainer module).
- Introduce a registry or factory pattern that later stages can extend without modifying call sites.
- Ensure command-line or config-driven entrypoint can be reused for subsequent demos.
