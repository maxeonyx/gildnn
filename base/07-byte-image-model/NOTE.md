# Byte Image Model

Objective:
- Reinterpret image data as byte sequences to align with the byte language model pipeline.

Key Requirements:
- Design serialization schemes from images to bytes (row-major, interleaved channels) with reversible decoders.
- Support compression-aware evaluation metrics (bits-per-byte, reconstruction error) alongside image-specific scores (PSNR, SSIM).
- Ensure batching utilities can handle variable sequence lengths caused by different image resolutions or color formats.

Integration Notes:
- Share vocabulary, embedding, and positional encoding logic with the byte language model stage.
- Allow cross-validation where the same architecture trains on both byte-text and byte-image datasets without code changes.
- Confirm that sampling utilities can render generated bytes back into visual artifacts for inspection.
