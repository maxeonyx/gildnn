# Research Experiments

This directory will collect research-oriented prototypes that build on the shared `base` implementations (e.g., dynamic depth, loss forecasting). At the moment all runnable baselines live under `base/`, and new exploratory work should create its own subdirectory here when it diverges from the core pipeline.
